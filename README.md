# Overview of BUILD
BUILD  is an open-source, cloud-based, and social platform that enables users with no UI development knowledge to create fully interactive prototypes. Without writing a line of code, you can perform user research, design the UI, include realistic data, and share the prototypes with colleagues. Developers can use the code of the prototype as a jumpstart to quickly create the app.
